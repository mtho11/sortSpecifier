sortSpecifier Test Code
=============

This test code was created to simulate the SortSpecifier error that is introduced by migrating from smartGWT 3.0 to smartGWT 3.0p (patch version 4/15/2013).
To use patch code follow the instructions at: [RHQ SmartGWT patch instructions](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/RHQ/GwtBuildDebugTips)

This code should see the same error as our code does but doesn't. This code actually works properly but is provided to help solve the support case:
